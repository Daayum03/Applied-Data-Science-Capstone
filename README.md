# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

The **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** is a comprehensive, 9-course program designed to build essential data science skills. Created by IBM and hosted on Coursera, the certificate provides practical, hands-on experience with real-world datasets, data science tools, and programming in Python. The curriculum covers the entire data science workflow, from data collection and visualization to machine learning and predictive modeling.

### Final Course Project

The **Capstone Project** is the culminating assessment, challenging learners to apply their skills to a real-world data science problem. In this project, you will:

- **Collect and Analyze Data:** Gather and clean a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
- **Data Visualization:** Create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- **Machine Learning Model Development:** Use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, evaluate their performance, and optimize them for accuracy.
- **Project Documentation:** Document your process, assumptions, and results, providing a clear and cohesive narrative of your data science approach.

This project showcases the integration of skills developed throughout the IBM Data Science Certificate, including data wrangling, visualization, and predictive modeling.
